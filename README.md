## IMPORTANT NOTE

This app is a prototype and is not intended for actual use in assessing English language proficiency nor is planned to be used in production. Most of the code (about %75) is generated by AI. The goal was to see how well AI can handle mobile app development and to experiment with the capabilities of AI. The app is compiling and running, but there might be bugs and issues that need to be fixed.
